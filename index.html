                <h4>Minimal</h4>
                <p>
                    Air.js was inspired by what I consider to be the best features of the most well-known single page application frameworks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides only the minimum set of components necessary for web application development, like Backbone.js</li>
                        <li>Follows an MVC, convention over configuration approach, like Ember.js (although much simpler)</li>
                        <li>Comes with all you need right out of the box like Angular.js (a.k.a batteries included), alghough these features can be easily replaced
                            by other external components</li>
                        <li>Integrates an opinionated set of guidelines for the application's architecture and data flow, similar to what Facebook's Flux does</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Lightweight</h4>
                <p>
                    Initial page load is one of the main concerns of Air.js. The library weights less than 8kb minified, which makes it viable for any sort
                    of web application.
                </p>

                <h4>Easily replaceable components</h4>
                <p>
                    Air.js is intended to be a standard way to join external components and libraries. All of its components are designed so that they can be easily
                    replaced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, you can swap Air.js's templating engine with Handlebars, integrate React to improve rendering performance, or manage all
                    DOM interactions with jQuery/Zepto, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please read <a href="http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015">this</a> article to further understand why this
                    approach is necessary.
                </p>

                <h4>Easy to learn, easy to use and easy to change</h4>
                <p>
                    No one likes learning a new front-end framework every week, so that's why Air.js was specifically designed to be super easy to use.
                    Getting started will only take you some minutes, and there's not that much more to it. Complexity is the first sign of bad architecture,
                    and your developers will thank you for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to change a certain feature of a given framework? Well, this is super easy in Air.js because its code is brief
                    and understandable, so re-writting a component is not complex at all. In fact I encourage you to do this if you want to replace any of the
                    framework's core components with external libraries, you'll only have to run the tests afterwards to make sure that everything still works as
                    expected.
                </p>
