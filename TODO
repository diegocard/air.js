TODO Coding:
- Check new ajax code against old one
- Add or remove "_" to the start of private objects (but make it a convention)
- Test filters and redirection methods (in app and controller)
- Change routes array in App.js and make it an object which already contains the controller that must be called.
  This object is passed on to the router on init. Reflect this changes on Router.js
  in router.
- View.js -> add each event of options.events on view creation (test it)

TODO Documentation:
- Document validations
- Document promises and new ajax methods

TODO Testing:
- Test validations (and return which validation is failing if a model is not valid)
- Test events
