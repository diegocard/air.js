TODO Coding:
- Make methods return "this" if they aren't returning anything
- Replace some for loops (specially in Router.js) with dry.each and test that it still works
- Rename/merge addRoute and add (in Router)
- Reverse parameter order in promises (err, res) -> (fulfilled, rejected) and add .catch method (make this A+ promises basically)
- Check ajax code against old one
- Add or remove "_" to the start of private objects (but make it a convention)
- Test filters and redirection methods (in app and controller)
- Change routes array in App.js and make it an object which already contains the controller that must be called.
  This object is passed on to the router on init. Reflect this changes on Router.js
  in router.
- View.js -> add each event of options.events on view creation (test it)

TODO Documentation:
- Document validations
- Document promises and new ajax methods

TODO Testing:
- UPDATE AJAX TESTS!!
- Test Ajax custom timeout (dry.ajax({timeout: 3000, ...}))
- Test validations (and return which validation is failing if a model is not valid)
- Change existing tests to include promises
- Test events
- Add more tests in general (models, ajax, events, page navigation, etc)
